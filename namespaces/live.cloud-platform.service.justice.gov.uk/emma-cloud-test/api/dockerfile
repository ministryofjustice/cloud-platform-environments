# Step 1: Use a Go base image
FROM golang:1.23-alpine as builder

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the Go source code into the container
COPY . .

# Install the necessary C dependencies for SQLite
RUN apk --no-cache add gcc musl-dev

# Step 4: Build the Go application inside the container
RUN go mod tidy
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o myapp .

# Step 5: Create a smaller final image to run the application
FROM alpine:latest

# Step 6: Add a non-root user to the container
RUN adduser -D myuser

# Step 7: Create a directory for the app and set ownership
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /app/myapp
RUN chown -R myuser:myuser /app

# Step 8: Expose the port (optional for web services)
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 9: Switch to the non-root user
USER myuser

# Step 10: Run the Go application
CMD ["/app/myapp", "serve"]
