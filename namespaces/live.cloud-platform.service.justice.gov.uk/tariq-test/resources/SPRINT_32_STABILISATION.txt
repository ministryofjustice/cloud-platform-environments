HAMMER LOG
**********

User Alex Davies is trying to view logs from 03/02 but there are large gaps in the results that are pulled back for the NS courtfines-prod


Conftest k8s yaml checks / conftest failing on multiple PRs (policy/clusterrole.rego:3: rego_parse_error: `if` keyword is required before rule body
policy/clusterrole.rego:3: rego_parse_error: `contains` keyword is required for partial set rules)

Only run each test on the specific file it's been targeted at - this requires the rego to be refactored into specific test per file testing

Change the action so that if it detects a file changed it scans all files in the users directory rather than just a specific one.
