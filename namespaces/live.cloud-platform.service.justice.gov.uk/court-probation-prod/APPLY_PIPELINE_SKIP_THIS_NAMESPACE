13/9/24 This looks like pending pingdom config changes:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # pingdom_check.crime-portal-gateway-check will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "pingdom_check" "crime-portal-gateway-check" {
        id                       = "13322886"
        name                     = "court-case-service"
      ~ tags                     = "cloudplatform-managed,crime-portal-gateway,hmpps,probation-in-court" -> " cloudplatform-managed, crime-portal-gateway, probation-in-court,hmpps"
        # (19 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

  # pingdom_check.prepare-a-case-production-check will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "pingdom_check" "prepare-a-case-production-check" {
        id                       = "7399512"
        name                     = "court-case-service"
      ~ tags                     = "cloudplatform-managed,hmpps,prepare-a-case" -> " cloudplatform-managed, prepare-a-case,hmpps"
        # (19 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 2 to change, 0 to destroy.
